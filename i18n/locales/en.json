Through visionary planning, innovative engineering, and a deep understanding of community needs, Al-Sibtain has created urban spaces that bring people together, inspire belonging, and reflect the values of trust, quality, and progress. From the ambitious Uruk City, to the serene Al-Salam City, and the world-class Al-Kafeel Hospital, each development tells a story of purposeful creation — a story that shapes the present and builds the future of Iraq. With a dedicated team of experts, architects, and engineers, Al-Sibtain continues to redefine modern development through sustainable practices, precision in delivery, and a commitment to timeless design.",
